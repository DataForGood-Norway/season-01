Gathering infos and tasks to organise our first season of projects

Github has improved and learned from other online tools in order to simplify project management. We are trying to use it here to organise our tasks related to the planning and implementation of this first seasonal datathon :100:


In particular, we will use the graphical representation of tasks that Github refers to as Project board, which is a Kanban board like [Trello](https://trello.com/b/TBUZ7pE5/kanban-board-example-w-scrum) would be more known for as an online tool.

[Project boards](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/projects): are ways to organise and to visualize flows of __tasks__ ([**issues** in Github](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/issues)).

  * A task can belong to one or multiple __goals__, or can affect one or multiple __deadlines__ (these are called [**milestones** in Github](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/milestones)).
  * A task can belong to only one project board.
  
  
  For this first season of projects, we started with 3 __project boards__:
  
  * [**Preparation**](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/projects/1)
  * [**take off**](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/projects/2)
  * and [**Landing**](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/projects/3)
  
  
  And with have different __millestones__ corresponding almost exclusively to our Meeting events:
  
 * [**Kick-off Meeting**](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/milestone/1)
 * [**Workshop 1**](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/milestone/2)
 * [**Workshop 2**](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/milestone/3)
 * [**Sprint #1 Review**](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/milestone/4)
 * **...**
 * [**Demo day (Final presenations)**](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/milestone/8)



In order to simplify the distribution of tasks, for each task, we could later on define the need for skills by using colored tags (called [labels](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/season-01/labels) in Github). **[Not done yet here]**

An easy way to keep track of your tasks is simply to filter a project board by assignee (e.g. To see the list of tasks assigned to __gahjelle__, simply type `assignee:gahjelle` in the search box.)

Here is the result for each one of us:
