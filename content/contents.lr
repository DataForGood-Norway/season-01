about:

__PyCon Philippines__ is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit conference centered around the Python Programming language.

The main goal of this conference is to provide a venue where the Python programming language and surrounding technologies can be explored, discussed and exercised.

We have an interest to gather software engineers, programming enthusiasts, startup founders, corporate IT decision makers, students and IT educators in a 2-day event where we can collaborate and learn with each other.

theme: This year's theme is _Diversity_. Our aim is to show that Python has something for everyone: from hobbyists, to educators, to professionals.
